# superstore-EDA-and-Time-Series-analysis

**Project Overview**  
This repository contains a two-part data analytics project built using retail/e-commerce sales data. The core focus is on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Time Series Analysis / Forecasting**.  
These analyses are aimed at uncovering insights in sales trends, identifying seasonal patterns, and providing forecasts for future periods.

##  Part 1 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this section, we perform:

- Data cleaning & preprocessing (handling missing values, converting types, dealing with outliers)  
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, quartiles)  
- Trend analysis over time (monthly, quarterly, yearly)  
- Category / region / product breakdowns  
- Visualizations: bar charts, line plots, box plots
These steps help us get a deep understanding of how sales, discounts, profits, and orders behave across different segments.

## Part 2 — Time Series Analysis & Forecasting

Here, we build upon the cleaned data and insights from EDA to do:

- Time series decomposition (trend, seasonality, residuals)  
- Autocorrelation / PACF analysis  
- Model fitting (ARIMA / SARIMA or other suitable models)  
- Forecast generation for future periods  
- Plotting forecasts against historical data  
- Model diagnostics & validation  

The aim is to forecast future sales and detect seasonal / cyclical behavior, which can help businesses in planning inventory, promotions, and demand management.
